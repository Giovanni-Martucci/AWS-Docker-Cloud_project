# cloud-project

This project aims to develop a web application in a distributed manner on AWS (using various AWS services offered by Amazon) with a Dockerization system (Docker). The application contains a control dashboard for real-time monitoring of data extracted from Arduino microcontrollers. Specifically, from the web interface, it is possible to retrieve the data generated by the microcontrollers for the probability of rain, the probability of sunny weather, and the temperature through a dedicated box. The data extraction is carried out through the microservices implemented in Node.js, which are invoked by the back-end connected to the web interface. They intercept the last message sent on the channel by Arduino, through a specific configuration of the MQTT communication protocol, in which the Arduino is involved as a publisher and publishes the values on a channel, while the microservices act as subscribers to the channel. Once the requested values are intercepted, they are sent to the web interface that triggered all the cascading calls. The following are some frameworks used in the development of this project: Angular, Node.js, Firebase, AWS, Docker. For demonstrative purposes, in this project, the data generated by the microcontrollers are simulated.
